 Thank you. Have you one? Thanks for joining us here at AluminumDusk. We wanted to give you a brief intro for our activity editor. Your default content, as you may notice, is very text-based, but you can add more interactive elements quite easily with AI or manually. So here you have a list of elements that you can select with a forward slash trigger, such as info panels, tables, dividers, multiple quiz-autchant types. And you can also add interactive code cells. We support Lambda and Jupyter back in runtimes out of the box. So it's a handy feature for people that would like to add coding exercises to their activities. And we also do support grading or automated grading with code cells and or quiz blocks. You can always preview the student version up here. See what the student view would look like. You can toggle back and forth. You can also access the chat feature, which can be connected to your context or your documents. So if you exit out of here and you access the context manager, this is available in the ProPlan. You can add documents such as PDFs, doc files, cells, CSVs. So if we go back to our course, you can chat with the AI at all times. By opening up threads, and you can copy that content into the activity, paste it. These blocks are drag and drop. So you can change the order of them as you see fit. And once you're ready to publish, once it's automatically saved, and once you're ready to publish, you can publish and invite your students to join your course or integrate with your favorite elements using SCORM or LTI. Thanks. We look forward to hearing from you soon. And we're excited to ship new features to save hours of your day. Thank you.
